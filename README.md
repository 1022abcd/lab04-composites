# Lab 04 - Composite Pattern

## Overview
Often an application will need to manipulate a collection of objects in the same way it would a single object. The composite design pattern allows objects to be composed of other objects in a tree, and to treat branches and leaves the same. In this way, your application can treat compositions of objects and individual objects uniformly.

## Objectives
- To learn and practice the composite pattern.
- To understand how recursive composition works.
- To compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies.

## Necessary Files
You will need to **fork** and **clone** this repository and open in VSCode or your favorite editor.
